# Salienteye: Maximizing Engagement While Maintaining ArtisticStyle on Instagram Using Deep Neural Networks
Style similarity experiment of Paper: Salienteye: Maximizing Engagement While Maintaining Artistic Style on Instagram Using Deep Neural Networks

## Requirements:
Python3
Numpy
Keras 2.1.2
Tensorflow 1.4.0

## Run the test
python style_test_oneforall

The default experiment is to plot the style classification confusion matrix of the following four account: thephotosociety, cats_of_instagram,travelalberta and clarklittle

## Dataset
We selected the 200 most recent photos from each of the seven accounts (All collected in 2019.4 and 2019.5). Of those photos, the 100 most recent photos are used tocreate a test set and the other 100 photos are used as reference photos to represent the style of the account.
